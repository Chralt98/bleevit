# Bleavit Zombienet environments

These committed topology, patch, drill, and helper definitions implement the
release-artifact obligation in [15 §4.7](../docs/architecture/15-invariants-and-testing.md)
and the Zombienet artifact row in [02 §11](../docs/architecture/02-integration-contract.md).
They are the definitions consumed by release and frontend e2e jobs, not private
fixtures.

> **15 §4.7:** “Zombienet relay + parachain topologies exercising epoch
> progression under collator loss, keeper loss, and relay finality stalls
> (dead-man test), plus the XCM reserve-transfer suites including failure,
> trap, and recovery.”

> **02 §11:** “Relay+para topology files + genesis overrides matching the
> release.”

## Reproduce

Run from the repository root:

```bash
tools/env/fetch-binaries.sh
tools/env/generate-relay-specs.sh
cargo build --release -p bleavit-node --locked
(cd keeper && cargo build --release --locked -p bleavit-keeper)
zombienet/bin/zombienet -p native spawn zombienet/networks/bleavit-local.toml
zombienet/bin/zombienet -p native test zombienet/drills/01-smoke.zndsl
```

The fetch script sources [`tools/env/pins.env`](../tools/env/pins.env), downloads
the linux-x86_64 relay worker quartet and Zombienet, and verifies every SDK
download against its release-published `.sha256` sidecar before installation;
the Zombienet release publishes no sidecars, so its binary is verified against
the `ZOMBIENET_SHA256` digest pinned in `pins.env`. Other hosts fail with a
pointer to build the pinned sources. The generator checks out the
Paseo chain-spec-generator tag in `target/env/`, verifies its immutable commit
pin, builds it with `--locked`, proves all three required local chain names are
accepted, and emits valid JSON specs. It then
reuses [`tools/deploy/generate-chain-specs.sh`](../tools/deploy/generate-chain-specs.sh)
for the Bleavit plain spec and converts that same spec to raw form for
Chopsticks.

[`genesis/drill-overrides.json`](genesis/drill-overrides.json) is a
chain-spec-builder patch, with its owning citations here because JSON has no
comment syntax. It repeats the release bootstrap `PhaseFlags = shadow |
sudo-present` and supplies seven deterministic dev guardians so the real 5-of-7
workflow is exercisable. It does **not** replace `Params`: the pallet seeds the
13 §1 registry from code, preventing a chain-spec parameter bypass.

No protocol timing is compressed: the seeded `epoch.length` is 302,400 blocks,
the expedited CODE descriptor lead is 43,200 blocks, playbook expiry remains
201,600 blocks, `dec.window` remains 43,200 blocks, and `mkt.obs_interval`
remains 10 blocks. Dead-man helpers poll relay best and finalized heads until the
real 4,800-block stalled-finality gap exists; they never substitute wall-clock
sleep for a block threshold.

## Run evidence

[`tools/env/run-evidence.py`](../tools/env/run-evidence.py) executes the suites
listed in [`tools/env/suites.json`](../tools/env/suites.json) against the built
release node, generated chain specs, and the exact release Wasm. After fetching
the pinned binaries, generating the specs, and building the node, a release-tier
Zombienet run is:

```bash
python3 tools/env/run-evidence.py \
  --kind zombienet \
  --tier release \
  --wasm release-work/runtime/runtime.wasm \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The four real-time long-horizon drills (`04`, `05`, `08`, and `09`) are G1-tier
and therefore recorded as tier exclusions in a release run. Evidence can be
emitted only by `--tier release`; `--tier g1`, `--tier all`, cherry-picked
`--suites`, and any custom `--zombienet-binary`, `--chopsticks-command`, or
`--node-binary` are report-only. Every release-tier drill of the emitted kind
must be attempted and pass, so a `gated_on` skip blocks evidence and
`--include-gated` is required while a release-tier gate remains. In evidence
mode, the default Zombienet binary is mandatory and its SHA-256 must match
`ZOMBIENET_SHA256` from `tools/env/pins.env`. A successful evidence-producing
run deletes downloaded binaries, generated specs, and prior evidence, then
hashes only the clean committed definitions (preserving the
generated-directory `.gitignore` files). The resulting `run-evidence.json`
follows the consumer contract in
[`tools/release/README.md`](../tools/release/README.md); release assembly remains
the final gate.

## Runnability

| Drill | Spec | Runnable-now assertions | Gated assertions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-smoke` | 15 §4.7; 02 §11 | Four relay validators and three collators start; para 4242 registers and produces included blocks | none |
| `02-collator-loss` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-18 (G1)**: pre-fault/post-fault/recovery height deltas over real native SIGSTOP/SIGCONT (V-24 confirmed) | none |
| `03-keeper-loss` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1 | **Passed end-to-end 2026-07-18 (G1)**: the real live-mode B9 daemon runs as Zombienet's `keeper` node (exec wrapper → keeper PID receives SIGSTOP/SIGCONT) and survives the pause/resume window; drill-asserted: pause/resume, `is up`, post-resume `bleavit_keeper_connected ≥ 1`, and parachain-height deltas proving collator liveness. Log-verified (not drill-asserted): role detection from live metadata | none |
| `04-dead-man` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1; 13 §2 | Native pause/resume, 4,800-relay-block RPC stall measurement, and the freeze-assertion surfaces (`epoch.deadMan`, `executionGuard.deadManFreeze`, phase-flag bit 6) — the A8/A11 wiring landed, so the helper's metadata gates pass | Engagement itself: **B10** owns the dead-man detector — no runtime path calls `note_dead_man_engaged` yet, so a real stall never raises bit 6; plus the ~8 h real-time stall (g1 tier) |
| `05-coretime-renewal-under-dead-man` | 09 §4/§7.1 | XCM topology, relay-block stall measurement, liveness deltas, and the renewal call's **exemption-reachability form**: the dispatch must traverse the staged freeze into treasury logic and fail exactly `RenewalWindowClosed` (09 §4 exemption proven; a filter/freeze rejection fails the drill). Quotes/`ops.coretime` funding are deliberately unstageable from a chain spec or signed call | Full **staged-renewal form** (success + `CoretimeRenewalCalled`, the 09 §7.1 Phase-1 exit form): the B4 quote-noting seam + the class-origin `fund_budget_line` path + `RenewalDispatch` wiring (B10) — until staged, a run under a live dead-man proves **freeze traversal only** (exemption-reachability), never a renewal, so the suite gate carries both entries; dead-man **engagement** additionally needs the B10 detector (see drill 04) |
| `06-pb-migration` | 09 §3.2/§7.1 | First execution (G1, 2026-07-18) proved the guardian machinery live: seven-seat membership read, usable-balance funding, `propose_action` + three `approve_action`s all execute against the real runtime | **SQ-235**: no `migrations.force_failure`/`retry` exists (the 09 §3.2 control-surface `[VERIFY]` is unresolved), so the `MigrationHalt` trigger can never go live in a drill and the fifth, dispatching approval correctly refuses with `TriggerInactive`. The playbook effect substrate landed with B1b (#104), so this control surface is again the drill's sole blocker |
| `07-xcm-reserve-transfer` | 15 §4.7; 09 §6.1 | v5 inputs and decoded source/destination event correlation are complete; bleavit/1 fails before AH debit; the recovery `ClaimAsset` send is dispatched through the local preset's **sudo** so it carries Asset Hub's bare chain origin (a signed send would descend to the signer's account origin and could never match the AH-chain-keyed trap) | SQ-101's Location-keyed USDC landed; the remaining gate is **B10**'s production XCM composition — `AssetTransactor`, `Barrier`, `IsReserve`, `IsTeleporter`, `OriginConverter` and the sender side are all fail-closed `()` today — plus the first post-`bleavit/1` spec bump the helper keys on; AH sudo presence in the generated local preset must be confirmed at first run |
| `08-expedited-code-under-freeze` | 09 §2.1/§3.2/§7.1 | B6 wires ExecutionGuard at slot 62; the receipt-aware authorize → early-reject → 43,200-block wait → apply definition targets that real surface | G1 setup must stage the attested queued proposal and active ledger freeze before the three-day lane runs |
| `09-three-unattended-epochs` | 15 §4.7; 09 §7.1; 13 §1 | Phase-1 G1 long-soak targets 907,200 blocks (3 × 302,400, split into three ≤ 2,000,000 s steps — Zombienet timeouts are 32-bit ms). Each step budgets 302,400 blocks per 2,000,000 s, i.e. assumes the kernel 6 s para-block cadence with ≈ 1.10× margin; confirm the observed local block rate before attempting the soak (a healthy 12 s-cadence chain would fail every step). The `EpochOf.index` assertion is armed (A8 wired) and the topology's `keeper` node supplies the epoch cranks; not a CI test | The ~63-day real-time run itself (SQ-128 holds it at the release-default epoch length) |

NOTE(G1): drill-authoring constraints established by the first real `zndsl`
executions (2026-07-17). The pinned Zombienet grammar (version:
`tools/env/pins.env`) accepts **no `#` comment lines** (drill rationale therefore lives in this README, spec
citations in the `Description:` line) and **requires a `Creds: config` line**
after `Network:`. All Zombienet timeouts — the toml `[settings] timeout` and
every DSL `within N seconds` — are converted to 32-bit signed milliseconds, so
values above 2,147,483 s silently overflow (the original 6,000,000 s network
timeout collapsed to a 1 ms watchdog); long waits must be split into
sequential ≤ 2,000,000 s steps as drill 09 does.

NOTE(B7, confirmed G1): the pinned `NativeClient` implements `pause`/`resume`
with `SIGSTOP`/`SIGCONT`. Upstream DSL documentation still describes those
commands as Podman/Kubernetes-only; the first end-to-end native executions
(drills 02/03, 2026-07-18) confirmed they work against real node and keeper
PIDs (V-24).

NOTE(B7, updated G1): `Epoch` (61) and `ExecutionGuard` (62) are instantiated
in the runtime; the drill-blocking absences are now the **B10** surfaces (the
dead-man detector and the XCM `AssetTransactor`/coretime staging seams) plus
the 09 §3.2 migration-control surface. Helpers intentionally fail with
precise messages when required state or metadata surfaces are absent;
supported boot/liveness assertions remain live.

## Mandatory closing try-state

The evidence runner does not yet execute the mandatory closing try-state.
Evidence emission is blocked (15 §1; SQ-204) until the leg lands: the runner
refuses to emit rather than emitting without it. With the collator RPC printed
by Zombienet (replace the port if allocated differently), run it manually:

```bash
try-runtime \
  --runtime target/release/wbuild/bleavit-runtime/bleavit_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm \
  on-runtime-upgrade --checks try-state --blocktime 6000 \
  live --uri ws://127.0.0.1:9944
```

Build that Wasm with the runtime's `try-runtime` feature before executing the
command. The same closing command applies to every drill, including smoke.
